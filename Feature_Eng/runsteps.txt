Here is the step-by-step guide on how to create and enter (activate) a Python virtual environment for your project.

Step 1: Open your Terminal or Command Prompt

Navigate to the folder where your project is located using the cd command.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
cd path/to/your/project
Step 2: Create the Virtual Environment (One-time setup)

If you haven't created one yet, run this command. It creates a folder (usually named venv or .venv) inside your project.

Windows:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python -m venv venv

macOS / Linux:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python3 -m venv venv
Step 3: Enter (Activate) the Virtual Environment

This is the specific step you asked for. The command depends on your operating system.

On Windows

If you are using Command Prompt (cmd):

code
Cmd
download
content_copy
expand_less
venv\Scripts\activate

If you are using PowerShell:

code
Powershell
download
content_copy
expand_less
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

(Note: If you get a permission error in PowerShell, run Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process first, then try activating again.)

On macOS or Linux
code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
source venv/bin/activate
Step 4: How to know you are "In"

Once you press enter, look at your command line prompt. You should see the name of your environment in parentheses at the start of the line, like this:

code
Text
download
content_copy
expand_less
(venv) C:\Users\YourName\Project>

or

code
Text
download
content_copy
expand_less
(venv) user@macbook project %
Step 5: How to Leave (Deactivate)

When you are done working and want to return to your global Python system, simply type:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
deactivate
Summary Checklist

Create: python -m venv venv

Activate (Win): venv\Scripts\activate

Activate (Mac/Lin): source venv/bin/activate

Install packages: pip install package_name (only works while activated!)
